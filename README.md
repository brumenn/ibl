Ready-to-use image-based lighting actor with built-in presets for Unreal Engine.


IBL is a plugin for Unreal Engine inspired from the built-in HDRI Backdrop plugin. It provides an Actor and a Data Asset that serve as preset for HDRI data, allowing to quickly setup an image based lighting in your scene.


Built with cinematics in mind, IBL try to fill HDRI Backdrop's weakness and get something easier to use as in traditional 3D softwares.

Mainly designed to be used in editor, for PBR surrounding lighting and background, product visualization workflow, and turntables in sequencer. Can definitely be used as packshot setup as well.
